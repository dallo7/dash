- **Financial Analysts:**  To explore and understand transaction patterns, agent performance, and market dynamics.
- **Business Decision-Makers:** To make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
- **Developers:** To learn how to integrate DAML with existing systems.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard:**
    - Visualizations:
        - Bar charts showing agent performance, market performance, transactions by sub-county, and transactions by county.
        - Pie chart illustrating the distribution of transactions across counties.
        - Interactive histogram for analyzing transaction trends over time.
    - Data Table: Upload and view financial data in a tabular format.
    - Filtering and Drill-down: Filter data by agents, markets, or counties to focus on specific aspects.
    - Animated Elements: Engaging Lottie animations enhance the visual appeal of the dashboard.
- **DAML Integration:** Demonstrates how to leverage DAML smart contracts for managing financial assets and agreements within the context of legacy systems.
